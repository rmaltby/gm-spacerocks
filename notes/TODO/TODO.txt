Ideas for things to implement:

High Scores

Music

Ship acceleration animation/sound

Background animations

Enable player to choose:
	Difficulty scaling (speed scaling rate with rock destruction 1%-100%?)
	Alternate controls
	Board size

Powerups:
	More: (Fireball, Freeze, Machine-gun, Shield, ???)
	Powerups as bitmask instead of integer to enable multiple powerups at once
		(may have to make certain powerups mutually exclusive if we use different bullet sprites)
	Randomize powerup duration and population rate
	Link explosion color to powerup generation and type

Alternative Ships:
	Different ships might have different:
		Speed/brakes
		Rotation rate
		Builtin shields/powerups
		Boosted likelihood of certain powerups
		???
